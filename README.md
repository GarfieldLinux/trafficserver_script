trafficserver_script
====================

An example DSL for writing traffic server plugins which compiles to C.

Requires: Flex and Bison

Note: this is a demo and is not complete, it's missing some code around regex string replacements and all of the helper methods such as set_url_property, set_header, and append_header are missing; however, these should be trivial to add.
